## After Installation

### Other RHEL distros

Might require libGLU or libxcb.

In case of libXss.so.1 missing, go ahead install libXScrnSaver

```bash
sudo dnf install libXScrnSaver-devel
```


### Fedora

SELinux is probably blocking your sesinetd from starting.
Below will solve the problem.

:::danger
Do not disable your SELinux.
Sesinetd can still work in'Enforced' mode.
:::

Register your service to systemd if not.

```bash
sudo cp /usr/lib/sesi/sesinetd.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable sesinetd.
```

#### Result
```
Synchronizing state of sesinetd.service with SysV service script with /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable sesinetd
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/sesinetd.service â†’ /etc/systemd/system/sesinetd.service.
```

Now enable your service 
```bash
sudo systemctl enable sesinetd.service
```

### Change Wayland to X11

As of Oct 2024, Houdini will crash on Wayland windowing system.

Change to X11

```bash
sudo vim /etc/gdm/custom.conf
```

Uncomment the following line

```
#WaylandEnable=false
```

### After Changing to X11

Houdini will not detect your GPU as OpenCL driver.

```bash
dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda
```

### Verify OpenCL with clinfo

```bash
dnf install clinfo
clinfo
```
