This document explains how to install Vaultwarden in a Docker environment with HTTPS enabled. It covers the process of installing Vaultwarden using Docker, obtaining a free domain through nip.io, and configuring SSL certificates with Certbot. It also includes setting up reverse proxy through NGINX and verifying HTTPS configuration.

# Install Vaultwarden on Docker with HTTPS enabled

### You should have

- Docker (Portainer as well)
- Host Linux OS 

### What we will do

- Install Vaultwarden and NGINX on Docker

- Get free domain by appending `.nip.io` to your IP address

- Configure SSL certificate with Certbot

### What we will get

- Vaultwarden with HTTP secure

- Reverse proxy of your web Vaultwarden with NGINX

- Free Bitwarden premium features! :smile:

## Install Vaultwarden on Docker

On your current terminal location,
```bash
mkdir vaultwarden
cd vaultwarden
```

then, create `docker-compose.yml`

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml 
vim docker-compose.yml
```

and here is the content of my docker-compose
```
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: always
    environment:
      # DOMAIN: "https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}.nip.io"
      SIGNUPS_ALLOWED: "true"
    volumes:
      - /opt/vw:/data
    ports:
      - 11001:80
```

```bash
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f
```

After that, check the status using `docker ps` or manage it through Portainer.

Access the local port 11001 to verify the interface:

`http://{LOCAL_IP}:11001`

However, since we're in an HTTP environment where plaintext is transmitted directly, let's set up HTTPS. (Vaultwarden is configured to not run in an HTTP environment anyway.)



## Let's get a certificate using Certbot Let's Encrypt

:::warning
I will assume you are using router that supports management.

Opeing port 80 (http) to get certificate is crucial otherwise it will fail.
Close the port after successfully obtaining the certificate.
:::

There are several ways to issue the certificates, but I'll use Docker with certbot + standalone method which I find the easiest.

When running the certbot Docker image in standalone mode, port 80 is required for the verification process, so we'll expose port 80 when running the container:
```
docker run -it --rm --name certbot \
            -v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
            -v "/var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt" \
            -p 80:80 \
            certbot/certbot certonly
```

Go ahead and select 1

1: Runs an HTTP server locally which serves the necessary validation files under
the /.well-known/acme-challenge/ request path. Suitable if there is no HTTP
server already running. HTTP challenge only (wildcards not supported).
(standalone)
2: Saves the necessary validation files to a .well-known/acme-challenge/
directory within the nominated webroot path. A seperate HTTP server must be
running and serving files from the webroot path. HTTP challenge only (wildcards
not supported). (webroot)

Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel): 1
```

Type your domain name

```
Please enter the domain name(s) you would like on your certificate (comma and/or
space separated) (Enter 'c' to cancel): {YOUR_DOMAIN}.nip.io
```

```
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{YOUR_DOMAIN}.nip.io/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/{YOUR_DOMAIN}.nip.io/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2099-00-00.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate will need to be renewed before it expires. Certbot can automatically renew the certificate in the background, but you may need to take steps to enable that functionality. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup for instructions.

```

Your certificate is now located in `/etc/letsencrypt`. Your certificate will expire in 90 days. To renew your certificate, try below command.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name certbot \
            -v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
            -v "/var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt" \
            -p 80:80 \
            certbot/certbot renew

```

## Install NGINX

Let's prepare docker-compose.yml and default config files in the same way we installed vaultwarden.

Since we'll be working in the terminal's current directory, place both files in the same location.

```bash
mkdir nginx
cd nginx
touch docker-compose.yml 
touch default.conf
vim docker-compose.yml
```

docker-compose.yml
```bash
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf 
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

default.conf
```
server {
  listen              443 ssl;
  server_name         {YOUR_DOMAIN}.nip.io;
  ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/{YOUR_DOMAIN}.nip.io/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/{YOUR_DOMAIN}.nip.io/privkey.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass        http://localhost:11001;
  }
}

```


```bash
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f
```

We are all good to go. If configured correctly, you should be able to access Vaultwarden with HTTPS.


## Verify HTTPS works 

I don't know any software aside from Wireshark, so I will be using Wireshark to diagnose packes.

#### HTTP

![](/assets/blog/https/vault_http.png)

`localhost:11001` will direct to your Vaultwarden but your web browser will give you a warning for sure.

![](/assets/blog/https/wireguard_http.png)

plain text confirmed!


#### HTTPS

Let's try https

https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}.nip.io

![](/assets/blog/https/vult_https.png)

![](/assets/blog/https/tls.png)

The website's certificate is valid and the packets are properly encrypted, making them unreadable.


## Enjoy!

I've implemented an additional security measure.

Case 1: If the database gets hacked, the passwords are already hashed, so there's no need to worry.

Case 2: If someone physically gains control of my Vaultwarden.

My main concern is **Case 2**, so I added an extra layer of protection by:

**Vaultwarden password + Mentally storing a 3-character suffix (or numeric, which I won't disclose)**

This simple technique enhances security through "something you have" (Vaultwarden) and "something you know" (mental suffix).

Since even a single character change completely alters the password hash, I hope this provides protection against potential attacks.
